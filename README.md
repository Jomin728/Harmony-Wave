Frontend clone of SoundCloud using Angular

I have created a music player application using Angular framework.

I have made use of angular routing ,services ,forms ,directives ,components in this application.

I have used Sound Cloud API to get the music playlists, tracks and audio files, search API to search playlists and tracks.

On selecting any track or playlist , the selection will be played, audio and slider for audio controls is added 

Also user is able to update playlist and create playlist from a track.

I have deployed the application in a docker container and its run on an AWS EC2 instance. URL- http://ec2-54-87-223-14.compute-1.amazonaws.com/home
